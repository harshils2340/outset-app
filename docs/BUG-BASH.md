# Bug bash log

One dated entry per overnight run: what was checked, what was found, what was fixed, what needs Harshil.

## 15 September 2026

**Checked.** `npm ci` and a clean type-check at the root and in `backend/`. The money path
(`scripts/payout-e2e.mts`) and the full rehearsal (`scripts/e2e-local.mts`, headless Chromium). Then by hand
against a local API on a throwaway store and a scratch Postgres: the guest (find a listing, pick a time, book as
a request and with Instant Book on, pay on site) and the operator (claim through the test bypass, edit, the
Published, Accepting and Instant Book switches, accept, decline, cancel, payouts). Double booking past capacity,
every email (guest and operator copies, founder alert, sign-in code, claim link), the money split, payout
scheduling, and odd input on every route that takes it.

**Found and fixed** (commit `5f07bf8`):

- **A pay-on-site booking charged whatever the browser sent.** The server only read the listing's own menu when
  Stripe was switched on, so with payments off a guest could book two $25 places and send a total of $1. The
  operator's email then read "Your price $1.00, you receive $0.95" and the guest's said the same. The price now
  comes from the listing on both paths. The card path already did this and is unchanged.
- **A booking was accepted for a listing that does not exist.** Any invented id stored a booking row and sent
  the founder a "CALL THE SHOP" alert for a shop that was never there. A clean read that finds neither the
  listing file nor a claimed profile answers 404; a store error still lets the booking through, so an outage
  cannot hide a real shop.
- **An impossible calendar day was bookable.** "2027-02-30" rolls forward to March 2, so the record kept one day
  and every email said another. Refused now, and the open-slots route refuses it as a `from` too.
- **24:00, 12:99 and 99:99 answered 409 "that time is not open"**, which reads to a guest like someone else took
  it. Bad input answers 400.
- **The payouts page named a pay day that had gone by.** A cycle pays on its Monday and a run on any later day of
  that cycle still pays, so from Tuesday on the dashboard said "Next payout, Monday, September 14" and filed
  money the very next run would send under "Scheduled for later pay days".
- **Emails never printed a year.** Bookings run up to a year ahead, so "Sunday, January 3" in a December email
  did not say which January. A trip in another year carries it now.
- **The harness left its servers running**, so a second run died with EADDRINUSE. It signalled only the npx
  wrapper, never the server behind it. Both start in their own process group now.

**Found and fixed** (commit `45a4446`): the rehearsal itself was broken by the move of the private store to
Postgres. The harness and its browser flow still read profiles and bookings as JSON files under the temp store,
so every check of what was actually saved failed and the run died with ENOENT before the emails were read. On a
clean checkout of `main` it reported Accepting, Instant Book, the guest's booking, accept, decline, the instant
confirmation and the cancel all broken when the API was answering correctly the whole time. It now reads the
same truth the dashboard does, through the API and the repo layer. Also, `payout-e2e.mts` exits 0 when it skips
for want of a database and the harness counted that as a pass, so a money path that never ran looked green; a
pass now requires checks to have actually run.

**Green after the fixes.** 31 rehearsal steps, 0 failed, with 43 money-path checks inside them. Both projects
type-check clean.

**Needs Harshil.**

- The rehearsal and the money-path test now need a scratch Postgres (`E2E_DATABASE_URL`). This run used a local
  cluster; on your Mac it wants `neon branches create --name scratch` and the pooled connection string. Without
  it both skip, and CI would report green having run nothing until the guard above.
- Nothing was checked against Stripe: no key was set, so the card path ran against the recorder only. The live
  capture, refund and Connect transfer settings still want a look in the Stripe dashboard.
- Render environment variables are untouched and unverified from here. `DATABASE_URL` is now what the API needs
  to serve at all, so confirm it is set on the API service before the next deploy.
